# Hack-A-Link

Hack-A-Link is an app designed for high school students. It removes the difficulties of starting a Hackathon independently and guides students through the process step by step. It also provides a platform to present high school-oriented Hackathons for other high schoolers to participate in. This app was developed for the 2024 Congressional App Challenge.

# Features

* Manage Hackathons through account(data saved)
* Step-by-step guide for creating a Hackathon as a student
* Allows other students to assist users in the creation/management of Hackathon
* Find existing Hackathons based on City, State, and Distance in Miles

# Setup

If you are hosting this project locally, there are a few things you need to do. I recommend you use Visual Studio code for the easiest setup. You can download this project and open it in VS Code. Then, in the terminal, you would run the following command to install the Flask dependencies, "python -m pip install flask". Once you have completed the following steps, in the app.py file, you will create your own secret key for the project to run off and input your API key for the Google Maps Geocoding API and GeoDB API. When you are done with all of these steps, in the terminal, you will run this command to start the project, "python -m flask run".
